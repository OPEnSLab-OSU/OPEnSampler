The Included Python Scripts are examples of using the serial puppet string commands to automate customized sampler functions.
For these to work, ensure:
Arduino Serial Monitor is closed - only one thing can have the arduino Serial port's attention (in this case, we want it to be Python)
Ensure Sampler is Powered on and Mode switch is toggled to Program Mode
Ensure the Port and Baud rate are correctly defined in the Python script and correspondes to the same port the Arduino is communicating on. Look for this line:
ser = serial.Serial('/dev/cu.usbmodem1411', 115200)
