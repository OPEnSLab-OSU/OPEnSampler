\f0\fs24 \cf0 OPEnSampler Bag v1 (Q4 2017)\
\
The OPEnSampler is an openly published water sampler designed with a focus on customizability. The device was designed in Autodesk Fusion 360, a free CAD software for any student or startup with low profits, specified by their terms for the license. \
\
The main features include an Arduino-controlled array of solenoid valves to manage the sample water flow and a 12VDC peristaltic pump, an extruded aluminum frame and 3D printed components for attaching the valves, bags, pump, and electronics to the device. The OPEnSampler fits in a Pelican 80QT Rolling Cooler and is powered from a 12VDC battery.\
