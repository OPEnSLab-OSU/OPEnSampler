OPEnS Water sampler Firmware Version 1.4
  Chet Udell, Mitch Nelke, 2017

  New in this version: Add RTC pin interrupt on pin 3 and Sparkfun Low-Power library to put to Arduino to sleep and wake up
  This may eliminate the need for MSTimer2 and ms_DEBUG
  MSTimer2 ISR will be ported over to the Pin3 ISR
  Remove SP serail command, replace with SA (sample alarm) to set (hr min ) each day to take sample. for testing, use this command to set to the next known min and wait. Or use switch on P2)

  TODO: Add code to handle RTC timer period set. Double check all enable/dissable timer things and replace with RTC interrupt functions instead
      Also, Add code for RTC timed functions for debug mode = 1 specify time in ms VS debug=0 for time in min
    May also need to remove or modify RES serial commmand function, no longer internal timer specific.
    Make SA serail function
    Make switch pin 2 ISR read time from RTC, reset alarm time for that time (send serial notification), proceed with taking sample.

The features of OPEnS Sampler 1.0 include:
24 sampler bags, 1 flush valve, 2 peristaltic pumps.
It takes about 2 min to draw 250ml, or 480ms per ml
1 Power Switch, 1 Sampler enable switch (because we want independent control of the timed sampler functions without cutting power, features that use this will be explained).
Serial Command Set, You can communicate with the sampler over USB serial at 9600 Baud. 

Arduino Pinouts:
GPIO2   - Sample enable/dissable low-true
GPIO3   - RTC Interrupt, low-true
GPIO9   - pump pin 1 (motor driver 1)
GPIO10  - pump pin 2 (motor driver 2)
~ SPI ~
GPIO8 - rClock - TPIC register clock
GPIO11 - SPI MOSI - TPIC Data
GPIO13 - sClk - TPIC serial clock
~ i2c ~
SCL/SDA = to RTC SCL/SDA

Sampler Use:
Power cycle on best practice: Be sure to supply the 12VDC source before plugging Arduino into USB
Power cycle off: unplug Arduino USB before unplugging 12VDC supply

1) Set global default variables and constants below to determine sampler behaviour. 
2) Ensure ms_DEBUG is properly set ot 0 or 1 depending on what you want (lab ms units or field Min units)
3) Program Arduino using this sketch connected by computer using USB cable. Ensure Board and Port settings under Tools tab are properly set
4) You may continue configuring and testing sampler functions over USB serial connection using the Serial Command Set (look at SerialCommandDefs tab)
5) At time of Deployment, send any serial commands you need to ensure you begin at your desired valve number or other settings

Firmware SAFETY Features:
Pumps will not turn on if no valves are open at that time. 
Likewise, turning off all valves (including flush valve) will automatically shut off pumps
